# supla-espressif-esp

## ⚠️ Repository status

This repository contains an **old Espressif-based SDK** for SUPLA devices.  
It is **only minimally maintained**, with development limited mainly to:
- keeping **basic feature parity with supla-device** for key functionalities,
- applying **critical bug fixes** when necessary.

No active development is planned beyond this scope.

### Recommendation

This repository is **not recommended for new projects**.

For ongoing and future development, use **[supla-device](https://github.com/SUPLA/supla-device)**, which is the current and actively developed SUPLA firmware framework.
